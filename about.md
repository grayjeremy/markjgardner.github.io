# Who am I?
I am a software engineer who specializes in DevOps and platform development. I enjoy building the tools and processes that enable application developers to deliver great experiences to their end users. I get particularly excited about orchestrating disparate systems into complex functional flows in order to solve unique business problems. I am an agile enthusiast and a strong proponent of declarative syntax, loosely-coupled architectures and doing test automation right.

# What's with the horses?
My wife and I live on a medium sized horse farm northeast of Louisville, KY. When I'm not automating my day job, I'm working on that farm. Every now and then the two parts of my life intersect so don't be surprised to find a post or two about modeling horse feed consumption against weather trends or improving training regimes by connecting a hot-walker and heart-rate monitor to an IoT hub.
